Part 3a:
1. public void exposeCells( int row, int col ) is called. 
	
2. public class MineSweeperGUI and class MineCell are the two classes.
MineSweeperGUI sets up the GUI of the game, The MineCell class provides the
state of the MineCell objects in the game grid and keeps track of details like
if a MineCell object's neighbords have been visited or been mined.

3. The MineCell class implements MouseListener and and the appropiate
MouseListener methods that are attached to each MineCell object.

4. The exposeSlowly method sets of a chain of exposes that are delayed in
milliseconds by the MineSweeperGUI instance variable DELAY. If you want to
change the animation speed change the DELAY instance variable.

5. The actionPerformed method dequeues MineCell objects from the toExpose
queue and exposes them. Also checks for a win.


Part3c:
When you play the game using breadth-first search you see the cells becoming
visible layer by layer. First the closest layer will unravel then the next
outer layer will unravel untill it done. When you play the game using
depth-first search you see the cells become visible quite differently. With
DFS you will see the cells become visible all the way until it reaches the end
of its chain and then you can see it travel back up and descend on the next
available chain.
